Correlations Between Atmospheric CO2 and Land Use Leveraged by Machine Learning

As the global human population continues to grow, so too does the output of greenhouse gases. Perhaps the most notable among these gases is carbon dioxide (CO2), which contributes to average global temperature increases leading to global scale shifts in Earth’s climate and natural system processes. While natural processes, such as plant-based photosynthesis, exist that likely a strong correlation to smaller regional-scale air quality, few correlative analyses have shown the relationship between land cover class and atmospheric CO2. Furthermore, no technologies exist that can determine CO2 content by using a simple land cover satellite image. The project presented here seeks to combine image detection and segmentation machine learning methods for Earth land cover images with atmospheric CO2 data to determine potential correlations between land cover classes and CO2 content. The project was executed by following the sequential steps listed below.

To accomplish this, CO2 content was collected from a study area within Minnesota and Wisconsin. This was obtained using NASA’s OCO-2 satellite dataset. The file oco2.nc4 contains CO2 data in parts per million (ppm) and corresponding geographic data. The file co2_data.ipynb examines this data file, which must be uploaded into a local directory, and extracts a few example CO2 data points along with their geographic coordinates. Next, five images, located in the images folder, were collected from Google Earth with the same spatial area. These images correspond to the locations of each CO2 data point used in subsequent analyses.

To analyze the collected images, an image classification convolutional neural network was utilized that determines the dominant land cover class. However, with only five images, there would be very few data points. Therefore, images were broken down to the pixel level after image classification model training, and each pixel was passed through the image classification model, shown in the file image_classification_CNN.ipynb. The percentage of pixels belonging to each class were determined for each image and recorded in the file co2_project.csv. These classifications may have error as they are assigned on a smaller pixel by pixel basis with a model trained for whole images. With each model training attempt saved to a local directory, variations may also occur. Though as most of the images appear to be in mostly forested land, ideally each image should contain mostly forested land cover classes. 

The csv file was then used for statistical and correlative analysis between atmospheric CO2 content and percent of pixels of a particular class across all images. This was done for each land cover class, as shown in the file stats.ipynb. While graphical representations and statistical analysis were done for forested land cla
